What's pysapi (Py Static API) about?
=====================================

This scrapebook introduces pysapi, a novel approach to building and deploying Python-based APIs as truly serverless, modular, and asynchronous static files, leveraging WebAssembly (WASM) and client-side Python runtimes. 

By decomposing API logic into per-route WASM modules and enabling on-demand, asynchronous loading and execution, pysapi dramatically reduces the initial load time, resource consumption, and hosting costs associated with API prototyping and experimentation. 

This modular architecture transforms traditional backend APIs into portable, read-only, static artifacts that can be hosted on any static site platform (e.g., GitHub Pages), eliminating the need for persistent servers and making API innovation accessible to all. 

The paper documents the design, implementation, and evaluation of pysapi, highlighting its potential for democratizing rapid API prototyping, its technical limitations, and the broader implications for serverless web architectures.
