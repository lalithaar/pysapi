What's pysapi (Py Static API) about?
-------------------------------------

Ever wanted to try out a simple API idea, but didn’t want to pay for server hosting or get tangled up in all that setup? pysapi is my experiment to make that easier.

With pysapi, you write your API in Python, bundle it up, and host it just like a regular static website—no servers needed, no monthly bills, no headaches. It’s a way to test ideas, learn, and build little APIs for fun or for yourself, without any gatekeeping.

This scrapebook is where I log all my experiments, notes, and thoughts as I figure out how to make it work. If you’re curious, want to follow along, or maybe try something similar yourself, you’re welcome here. There’s no pressure and no fancy tech talk—just honest notes, gentle nudges, and the hope that building cool things can be simple and accessible for everyone.
